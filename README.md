# Qpcr_Project

This is a project which aims to automate the analysis of a Qpcr run.
It aims to extract ct values and perform a statistical analysis for each gene found in the request normalized using housekeeper genes.

Secondly a correct statistical analysis is performed and the resulting data and significance is visualized.

The program should be user friendly and might be hosted over the web using something like flask. 

The goal is to have each separate module of the project be fitted with ample testing and reporting in case of (user)-error with a clear communication.
